career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      
      I am an open-source developer at IBM, and have been involved with the Egeria project (LF AI & Data) since inception as a co-founder, and maintainer, collaborating with others on delivering an open, extensible, metadata & governance platform.
  
      I have a passion for open source, which underpins so much of today's software solutions. Open source thrives on community engagement, open discussions, honesty, integrity, and delivery. Equally, this same pattern occurs within an organization as a collaborative inner-source approach is increasingly adopted.
  
      I enjoy taking a project from inception to reality doing whatever it takes. This includes looking at best practices and introducing new approaches and technologies, as well as digging into detail and analysing root cause of issues. Whilst on Egeria I was responsible for many new areas as I identified gaps & did not let not knowing a technology get in the way. Learning about new technologies, and introducing them appropriately to solve problems is integral to my approach to develop software solutions.
        
      A successful future role would combine working in an open and engaging community with further developing skills areas I already have, alongside developing skills in new technologies, to deliver solutions to business problems that can make a difference.
