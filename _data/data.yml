career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      
      I am an developer at IBM, and have been involved with the Egeria open source project (LF AI & Data) since inception as a co-founder, and maintainer, collaborating with others on delivering an open, extensible, metadata & data governance platform.
  
      I enjoy taking a project from inception to reality doing whatever it takes. This includes looking at best practices and introducing new approaches and technologies, as well as digging into detail and analysing root cause of issues. Whilst on Egeria I was responsible for many new areas as I identified gaps & did not let not knowing a technology get in the way. Learning about new technologies, and introducing them appropriately with a good understanding of requirements and constraints, is integral to my approach to developing software solutions.
      
      I have a passion for open source, which underpins much current software. Open source thrives on community engagement, continual sharing, open discussions, honesty, integrity, trust, and delivery. Equally, this same pattern occurs within an organization as a collaborative inner-source approach is increasingly adopted.

      A successful future role would combine working in an open, diverse, and engaging community whilst improving skills I already have, alongside developing skills in new technologies, to deliver solutions to business problems that can make a difference.
