career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am currently an open source developer at IBM, and have involved with the Egeria project (LF AI & Data) since inception as a co-founder, and maintainer, collaborating with others on delivering an open, extensible, metadata & governance platform.
  
      I have a passion for open source, which underpins so much of today's IT offering immense business value. Open source thrives on community, as well as organizations that can see the value in contributing to it's success.
  
      I also enjoy taking a project from inception to reality - in Egeria this has included not just architecture, code, design, documentation, but implementing ci/cd for over 350 modules across over 30 repositories, test automation, developing our first demo infrastructure using Juypter/python & containers, and driving that containerization through writing helm charts, kubernetes deployments & operators. Then getting to the bottom of resource, performance issues through determination and diligence whilst communicating clearly and sharing rapidly.
  
      Over 2,200 contributions to GitHub in public repositories in the year up to 8 May 2023. https://github.com/planetf1
  
      In my own time I love getting out exploring new places, and doing what I can to support mitigation of climate change.
