career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      
      I am currently an open-source developer at IBM, and have been involved with the Egeria project (LF AI & Data) since inception as a co-founder, and maintainer, collaborating with others on delivering an open, extensible, metadata & governance platform.
  
      I have a passion for open source, which underpins so much of today's software solutions. Open source thrives on community engagement, open discussions, honesty, integrity, and delivery. Equally, this same pattern occurs within an organization as inner-source is increasingly a standard way of working.
  
      I also enjoy taking a project from inception to reality doing whatever it takes. This includes looking at best practices and introducing new approaches and technologies. Whilst on Egeria I was responsible for many additions, especially beyond the core Java Architecture embracing CI/CD, Security, Demos, Containerization/Kubernetes, Jupyter as I identified gaps & did not let not knowing a technology get in the way. Learning about new technologies, and introducing them appropriately to solve problems is integral to my approach to develop software solutions to business problems.
        
      In my own time I love getting out exploring new places, and doing what I can to support mitigation of climate change.
